We used sequencing data from [1] (BioProject accession PRJNA647337, SRA Study identifier SRP273483) for the comparison with TAD boundaries. Integration sites were mapped from VSV-G pseudotyped HIV- 1 luciferase and GFP reporter viruses infected WT Jurkat cells, LEDGF/p75 Knockout (LKO), LEDGF/p75 KO reconstituted with LEDGF/p75 lacking the Integrase Binding Domain (IBD-/-), CPSF6 Knock down (CKD), as well as WT Jurkat cells infected with HIV-1 N74D or A77V capsid (CA) mutants. 
The data was downloaded from Sequence Read Archive on April 27th 2021. Firstly, reads were filtered to keep only those where one of the pair had a match with linker sequence, when applicable. Reads were then trimmed using bbduk2 program from BBTools package 2 (version 37.23) [2] in the following way: presence of viral genome and linker sequence was detected in the reads. In forward reads, part of sequence to the left of viral match and to the right of linker match were removed using parameters qtrim=rl trimq=10. In reverse reads, part of sequence to the left of linker match and to the right of viral match were removed using parameters qtrim=rl trimq=10 mink=9.
Trimmed reads were mapped to both human genome (hg19) and HIV-1 genome (NC_001802.1, downloaded from RefSeq database on April 30th 2021), and filtered to retain only unique primary mappings with mapping quality over 30. Additionally, reads mapped to hg19 had to be properly paired and members of a pair positioned no further than 900 bases apart. Reads longer than 20 bp which passed the filters on HIV-1 genome were excluded from mapping on hg19, and the remaining reads on hg19 were deduplicated. Finally, only forward reads mapped to hg19 were kept as indication of potential integration sites. Mapping was done using BWA-MEM 3 version 0.7.12 [3] with default parameters, filtering and deduplication by Sambamba software (version 0.6.7) [4], and removal of reads properly mapped to HIV-1 genome with FilterSamReads utility from Picard [5] command line tools package, version 2.25.4.
All discrete areas with mapped reads (so-called "islands") were further analysed in R software environment [6] version 3.6. Exact position of potential integration site was determined as the first base with maximal coverage detected in that island. Coverage of top 25% longest islands in each sample was inspected: if more than 85% of island length had coverage exceeding upper quartile of average island coverage in that sample, the island was marked as saturated. Next, genome was divided into 100 bp bins and integration sites appearing in the same bins were marked as duplicates. For in-sample duplicates (probably representing imprecise mapping on the same integration site), only the integration site with highest enrichment was kept. All duplicates across samples were discarded if one of them was saturated (indicating that read mapping to that position is probably an artifact of sequencing or mapping process rather than actual integration site). Remaining duplicates across samples were collapsed to keep only the integration site with highest enrichment. In this way, unique HIV-1 integration sites were detected. Number of IS obtained were the following: WT (N=823,169), LKO (N=65,717), IBD-/- (N=81,346), CKD (N=91,081), N74D and A77V (N=726,694). Results were lifted over to hg38 for further analysis.
